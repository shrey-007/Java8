In Java 8 we can use the method as if they were objects or primitive values, and we can treat them as a variable.    
Method references are a special type of lambda expressions.  
They're often used to create simple lambda expression by referencing existing methods.  
Each time you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference  

Method reference operator &rarr; ::   

#### Syntax &rarr; ClassName::methodName

Types of Method References-:
1) Static Methods
2) Instance methods of particular objects(non static methods) 
3) Constructor
